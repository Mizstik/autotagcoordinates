# Auto Tag Coordinates

This is a Factorio mod which allows you to automatically append coordinates when creating map markers / chart tags.

## Features

* Octant and cartesian systems available.
* Append from left or right side of tag text.
* Enclose coordinates with () or [] or none.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Acknowledgments

* Special thanks to YARM and Schall Map Tags whose code allowed me to learn how to do this.
